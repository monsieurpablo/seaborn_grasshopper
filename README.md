# Seaborn Grasshopper
A rhino remote library that brings Seaborn (Matplotlib) inside of Grasshopper using [Hops](https://github.com/mcneel/compute.rhino3d/tree/master/src/ghhops-server-py). 
Based on the initial release of [Hops_plots](https://github.com/MaesAntoine/Hops_plots) by MaesAntoine. 

This implementation brings the following enhancements:
- Ready for web deployment using Heroku and gunicorn
- Export image as a encoded b64 string
- Style improvement
